1.What is CDN?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network that helps to speed up web page loading for web users. It is spread all over the world as usage of the internet is everywhere. It is basically a distributed system of servers

2. What is CORS?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

3. How does a browser know when to use a CDN and when not to use it? 
4. Why do we need Content Delivery Networks (CDN)?
5. Can you explain the difference between HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 in terms of performance?
6. Explain how DNS works with respect to websites.
7. What are cookies and sessions in web development?
Key Differences:

Storage: Cookies are stored on the user's device, while session data is stored on the server.
Persistence: Cookies can be persistent or session-based, while sessions are typically temporary and tied to a user's browsing session.
Scope: Cookies are scoped to a specific domain and can be accessed by both client-side and server-side scripts, while sessions are usually accessible only on the server side.
In summary, cookies and sessions are both used to maintain state in web applications, but cookies are stored on the client side, while sessions are stored on the server side. They are often used together to create personalized and interactive web experiences.

8. What is server-side rendering vs client-side rendering?
9. What is progressive rendering?
10. What is lazy loading?
11. When should I use data URIs instead of using img tags for images?  
12. How can I optimize my website's load time by implementing image compression techniques?
13. How does a CDN work with CORS?
14. Can you explain the difference between "public" and "private"?  
15. Why do we need to use  HTTPS instead of HTTP in web development?
